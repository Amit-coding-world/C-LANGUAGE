// 1. define a function to input variable length string and store it in an array without memory wastage .
// 2. wap to ask the user to input a  no. of data values he would like to enter then create an array  dynamically to accommodate the date values.
//  now take the input from the user and display the average of data values.
// 3. wap to calculate the sum of n numbers entered by the user using malloc and free.
// 4.write a function to merge two array elements and store it in dynamically created array . return address of this dynamically created array.
// 5. define a structure students with name,roll no. and college  name a members.define another structure team with two students type varibles as members.
// 6. in ques 5. define a method to dynamically create a student type variable and intialise with the values received in the arguments .return addres of student type variable.
